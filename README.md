# DXFExtractor
For extracting entities and attributes of entities from DXF files, with the aid of the handy ezdxf module! In progress with revised versions, and will often contain very specific code with *issues*, but my aim is to eventually create a code with extracts the attributes of every entity within the user defined DXF file.
